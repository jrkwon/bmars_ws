## Connecting the Sensor

If directly connecting to the host machine you may need to set your Ethernet interface to `Link-Local Only` mode. This can be done via the command line or GUI. 

### GUI

- Find `Wired` at Settings - Network. 
- Select the `IPv4` tab. 
- Under `IPv4 Method`, select `Link-Local Only`
